            <h4>The Web</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The web —a complex system of interconnected components which has become
                    a global repository of vast distributed heterogeneous data and services. The
                    web has metamorphosed through generations from web 1.0 —which allows for
                    published contents to be searched and read (read only), through web 2.0 —
                    which allows for dynamism and collaborations (read and write) to web 3.0 —
                    which extends collaboration by allowing machine participation (read, write, and
                    execute). Web 3.0, also referred to as the semantic web, became incumbent as
                    a result of the need to efficiently and effectively exploit the massive information
                    and services on the web.</p>

                    Tim Berners-Lee presented a proposal for an information management system that would
                    enable the sharing of knowledge and resources over a computer network. We now know this

            <blockquote>
                <p>In 2006, the concept of Web 3.0 was introduced during the Technet Summit. Jerry Yang, the founder of
                    Yahoo, acknowledged the hardware and software challenges associated with Web 2.0 and proposed the
                    need
                    for a new, truly inclusive web platform. He believed that the power of the web had reached a
                    critical
                    point and called for a web vehicle that would bridge the gap between professional, and
                    semi-professional
                    users, and consumers, encouraging collaborative web interactions and network effects. This new
                    generation of web business and applications became known as Web 3.0.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Since then, influential figures in the internet community, including Google CEO Eric Schmidt and
                    Nifty
                    founder Reed Hastings, have contributed to the discourse surrounding Web 3.0. Tech entrepreneur and
                    investor Chris Dixon has described Web 3.0 as an internet for both builders and users, where digital
                    assets play a crucial role in connecting them.</p>
                <p>However, there is no universally accepted definition of
                    Web 3.0.Web 3.0 represents the tangible manifestation of current technology trends moving towards a
                    new level of maturity. These trends include the internet, network computing, open technologies, open
                    identities, intelligent networks, distributed databases, intelligent applications, and more.</p>

                <p>Way back during Christmas 1990, Sir Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN built all the tools
                    necessary for a working web. They created HTTP, HTML, and the world's first web browser,
                    called WorldWideWeb. The web pages that the first browser could run were simple plain-text
                    pages with hyperlinks. In fact, those first web pages are still online and available to view today.

            <h4>Semantic Web</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Semantic Web technologies are a set of standards and protocols aimed at enhancing the meaning and
                    understanding of data on the World Wide Web. Unlike traditional web technologies that primarily
                    focus on
                    the presentation of information, Semantic Web technologies aim to enable machines to comprehend the
                    semantics or meaning of data, facilitating more intelligent data processing and interaction. At its
                    core, the Semantic Web is based on the principles of annotating data with metadata that describe its
                    meaning and relationships in a machine-readable format. This metadata enables automated reasoning,
                    inference, and integration of disparate data sources, thereby enabling more sophisticated
                    applications
                    and services.</p>

                <p>In addition to the classic “Web of documents” and the ontologies, the paradigm of
                    publication, linking, and consumption of data has evolved to support a “Web of
                    data”, whose main goal is generating a global Linked Data ecosystem known as
                    Linked Open Data cloud (LOD cloud), which enables the computers to do more
                    useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the
                    network. In this sense, the Web of data enables developing vertical applications that
                    may bring forward specific and sometimes highly non-trivial use cases, focusing to

                    human
                    race has created an astoundingly diverse network of hyperlinked documents. HTML5 is the latest
                    iteration of this lingua franca. While it is the most ambitious change to our common tongue, this
                    isn't
                    the first time that HTML has been updated. The language has been evolving from the start.</p>

                    Berners-Lee. In 1991, he wrote a document called “HTML Tags” in which he proposed fewer than two
                    dozen elements that
                    could be used for writing web pages.</p>

                <p>Sir Tim didn't come up with the idea of using tags consisting of words between angle brackets;
                    those kinds of tags already existed in the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) format.
                    Rather than
                    inventing a new standard, Sir Tim saw the benefit of building on top of what already existed—a trend

            <blockquote>
                <p>OSI Network Architecture 7 Layers Model Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model
                    developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 1984, as a conceptual framework
                    of
                    standards for communication in the network across different equipment and applications by different
                    vendors. It is now considered the primary architectural model for inter-computing and
                    internetworking
                    communications. Most of the network communication protocols used today have a structure based on the
                    OSI
                    model.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <cite>(Network Protocols Handbook 2007)</cite>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The TCP/IP Protocol Suite. TCP/IP, the protocol on which the Internet is built, is not a single
                    protocol but rather an entire suite of related protocols. TCP is even older than Ethernet. It was
                    first
                    conceived in 1969 by the Department of Defense. For more on the history of TCP/IP, see the sidebar,
                    “The
                    fascinating story of TCP/IP,” later in this chapter. Currently, the Internet Engineering Task Force
                    (IETF) manages the TCP/IP protocol suite.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The TCP/IP suite is based on a four-layer model of networking similar to the seven-layer OSI
                    model. Figure 1-7 shows how the TCP/IP model matches up with the OSI model and where some of the key
                    TCP/IP
                    protocols fit into the model. As you can see, the lowest layer of the model, the network interface
                    layer, corresponds to the OSI model's physical and data link layers. TCP/IP can run over a wide
                    variety
                    of network interface layer protocols, including Ethernet, as well as other protocols, such as token
                    ring
                    and FDDI (an older standard for fiber-optic networks). The application layer of the TCP/IP model
                    corresponds to the upper three layers of the OSI model — the session, presentation, and application
                    layers. Many protocols can be used at this level. A few of the most popular are HTTP, FTP, Telnet,
                    SMTP,
                    DNS, and SNMP.</p>

                    that we interact with daily. The client-server model is at the heart of REST, defining clear roles
                    and responsibilities for both clients and servers. APIs also encourage modularity, reusability, and
                    collaboration among development teams. Rather than building everything from scratch, developers can
                    focus on their core competencies and utilize APIs to handle specialized tasks such as payment
                    processing, authentication, geolocation, and more.</p>

                <p>GraphQL: A Paradigm Shift in API Querying. GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that
                    enables clients to precisely request the data they need, reducing over-fetching and minimizing
                    round-trips to the server. Its key advantages include: Efficiency: Clients control the data they
                    receive, eliminating unnecessary data transfers. Flexibility: A single GraphQL endpoint allows for
                    complex queries and mutations. Strong typing: A schema defines the available types and operations,
                    leading to clear and validated documentation.</p>

            <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a strategy for providing appropriate layouts
                    to devices based on the size of the viewport (browser window). The key to
                    Responsive Web Design is serving a single HTML document (with one URL)
                    to all devices, but applying different style sheets based on the screen size
                    in order to provide the most optimized layout for that device.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In 2010, Ethan Marcotte gave name to another, more flexible solution in
                    his article “Responsive Web Design” (alistapart.com/article/responsive-webdesign),
                    which has since become a cornerstone of modern web design. In this
                    chapter, I will follow the “ingredients” for RWD that Ethan outlines in his
                    book Responsive Web Design (A Book Apart).</p>
                <p>The technique has three core components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A flexible grid
                        Rather than remaining at a static width, responsive sites use methods that
                        allow them to squeeze and flow into the available browser space.</li>
                    <li>Flexible images
                        Images and other embedded media need to be able to scale to fit their
                        containing elements.</li>
                    <li>CSS media queries
                        Media queries give us a way to deliver sets of rules only to devices that
                        meet certain criteria, such as width and orientation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To this list of ingredients, I would add the viewport meta element, which
                    makes the width of the web page match the width of the screen. That's where
                    we'll begin our tour of the mechanics of RWD.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>We can make the page more mobile friendly by adding this snippet in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:
                    <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" / &gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p>This viewport meta tag is the non-standard but de facto way of telling the browser how to render
                    the page. Although introduced to the web by Apple, rather than a standard process, it remains
                    essential for responsive web design.</p>

                <p>Git is a technology that can be used to track changes to a project and to help multiple people to
                    collaborate on a project. At a basic level, a project version controlled by Git consists of a folder
                    with files in it, and Git tracks the changes that are made to the files in the project. This allows
                    you to save different versions of the work you're doing, which is why we call Git a version control
                    system.</p>
                <p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds to version control the work done on a large software development
                    project called the Linux kernel. However, since Git can track changes to all sorts of files, it can
                    be used for a wide variety of projects.</p>
